# HW2 - Pandas and Data Wrangling

The goal of this hoework is to test your skills on using the `Pandas` library for a few basic data wrangling tasks.

The homework consists of `2` tasks, provided and described in the following notebooks:

    1.HW2_Task_A_Lego.ipynb

    2.HW2_Task_B_Drop_the_bike.ipynb

In order to solve these tasks, use the `data` folder provided.

For each exercise, please provide *both* a written explanation of the steps you followed, and the corresponding code. 

Keep in mind that writing the explanation can help you in two ways: 

1) clarifying the steps in your mind before writing the actual code, 

2) earning you points if the description is correct, regardless of the potential issues in your code.


### Deliverables
`HW2_Task_A_Lego.ipynb` and `HW2_Task_B_Drop_the_bike.ipynb` notebooks with disclosed output for each cell. 
Both notebooks should be submitted through the course canvas page.

#### Submission Deadline: September 23, 11:59 PM

#### Bonus Points: Early submission
If you submit the entire homework no later than 24 hours before the deadline, and the total score on the rest of this homework assignment is at least 10 points, you will receive 5 bonus point. The bonus point will be added to the total score of this homework assignment.
