For each of the two intervals calculate the proportion of trips by *passholder type* and *trip route category*. Present your results in a `DataFrame` which has a unique, non-composite index. Does the proportion of trips depend on whether it is the first or second hour interval? Would the company have any significant benefit by creating a more complex paying scheme where monthly pass users would pay less in the first interval and (equally) more on the second one? Assume that the number of trips per interval will not change if the scheme changes."
